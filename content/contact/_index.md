Description: >
            In 2008, Mikita Mikado spent six hours designing a business proposal. Losing both time and patience, 
            he looked at future co-founder, Sergey Barysiuk, and the idea of Tutive was born. Today, 
            Tutive empowers sellers to easily transact with customers through personalized documents that can be created 
            in minutes, build meaningful relationships, and win more deals.
